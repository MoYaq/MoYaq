# **Hi there, I'm Moyaq ðŸ‘‹**

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a passionate PharmD student and aspiring pharmacist with a strong belief in the power of technology. Iâ€™m focused on developing my tech skills because I believe that in an ever-evolving world, those without digital skills will be the "illiterates" of the next generation.

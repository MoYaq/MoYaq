# **Hi there, I'm Moyaq 👋**

**Welcome to my GitHub profile😁🤗**

I’m a passionate PharmD student and aspiring tech-enthusiast eager to harness the power of technology to drive innovation in healthcare. I’m currently on a journey to learn and equip myself with digital skills such as **Python programming, Machine Learning (ML), Artificial Intelligence (AI), data analysis, and automation**. These skills will complement my pharmaceutical knowledge, particularly in my aspiring specialities: **oncology and cardiology**, enabling me to:
* 🔬 Improve healthcare outcomes with data-driven insights
* 🤖 Create AI-powered tools for personalized medicine
* 💊 Optimize patient care and medication management using automation

> **My view💬:** The world is continually evolving in technology, and those without digital skills will be the "illiterates" of the next generation.

### 🌟Currently Working (Learning) On:
	Learning Python programming through a 90-day Python challenge I recently joined.

### ⏭️My Next Plan Is to Learn and Delve Deeper Into:
1. Python (continuing to improve)
2. Advanced Data Analysis Techniques
3. Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI)
